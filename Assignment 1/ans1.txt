1. I typed in the man man command to read about how I could use the
man command. I learned that I could use man -k followed by a keyword
to find all commands that include the keyword.

2. I used whereis cp to find the path of cp: /usr/bin/cp   
   I also used whereis wc to find the path of wc: /usr/bin/wc

3. There are three one character executable files found with the command 
find /usr/bin -executable -name ?. I learned about this specific command 
from reading the man find documentation, where I learned how to use the 
-executable command that searches for executable programs. I found the 
description of each executable from the commands man [, man X, and man w.
   [: this is an executable that acts as a condition evaluation utility
   X: this is a network-transparent window system that is portable
   w: this is an executable that displays who is currently logged in 
   and what they are doing

4. I used ls -al /usr/bin/emacs which showed me that the actual file 
being executed is: /etc/alternatives/emacs

5. The symbolic mode g+s means that the other users in the file's group 
have permission to set user or group ID on execution of the file.  
The symbolic mode o-x means that the other users not in the file's 
group no longer have the ability to execute or search a directory.
In regards to permissions, users in the file's group are allowed to set 
user or group ID upon execution and users not in the file's group do 
not have the ability to execute or search.
I found these commands by reading the documentation provided by the 
command man chmod.

6. In order to see all files modified within the last 3 weeks, I typed 
in find -mtime -22 to find all files that have been modified in the 
last 21 days. The documentation found under man find describes that 
the numerical argument of -22 means it will find any file that has been 
modified strictly less than 22 days, so not including any file that was 
modified 22 days ago or above. 

7. Here are all of my directories that have been modified in the last 
3 weeks:
   .
   ./Desktop
   ./Desktop/desktop.ini
   ./Desktop/Google Chrome.lnk
   ./Documents
   ./Downloads
   ./Downloads/desktop.ini
   ./Downloads/supp1.zip
   ./Downloads/supp1 (1).zip
   ./Downloads/FoxitReader802_enu_Setup_Prom.exe
   ./.bash_history
   ./.cache/abrt
   ./.cache/abrt/lastnotification
   ./.Xauthority
   ./.emacs.d/auto-save-list
   ./.emacs.d/auto-save-list/.saves-22102-lnxsrv04.seas.ucla.edu~
   ./.emacs.d/auto-save-list/.saves-14776-lnxsrv07.seas.ucla.edu~
   ./.viminfo
   ./.lesshst
   ./#test#
   ./.#ans1.txt
   ./#ans1.txt#
   ./ans1.txt

8. I first used whereis find to locate the directory it was under (bin). 
Once I navigated to bin, I typed in find . -type l -ls to print out all 
the symbolic link files in the bin directory. I found 242 symbolic link 
files in the bin directory.

9. I first navigated to /usr/lib, and then I typed in the command man 
ls to learn about the ls command. I learned that I could use ls -lt in 
this directory to find the oldest regular file. I found that the oldest 
regular file was: drwxr-xr-x.  6 root root    4096 Sep 29  2014 kbd.

10. After I typed the command man locale, I learned that the data is 
obtained from environment variables. I later typed in man -k locale 
and found that localedef defines the locale environment, and thus is 
where the data originates.

11. 
Buffer-menu-sort              M-x ... RET
   Sort Tabulated List entries by the column at point.
sort-columns                  M-x ... RET
   Sort lines in region alphabetically by a certain range of columns.
sort-fields                   M-x ... RET
   Sort lines in region lexicographically by the ARGth field of each
   line.
sort-lines                    M-x ... RET
   Sort lines in region alphabetically; argument means descending
   order.
sort-numeric-fields           M-x ... RET
   Sort lines in region numerically by the ARGth field of each line.
sort-pages                    M-x ... RET
   Sort pages in region alphabetically; argument means descending
   order.
sort-paragraphs               M-x ... RET
   Sort paragraphs in region alphabetically; argument means descending
   order.
sort-regexp-fields            M-x ... RET
   Sort the text in the region region lexicographically.
tabulated-list-col-sort       M-x ... RET
   Sort Tabulated List entries by the column of the mouse click E.
tabulated-list-sort           M-x ... RET
   Sort Tabulated List entries by the column at point.

I used C-h a sort to use the apropos command under the help functionality 
of emacs in order to show commands that matched the string sort.

12. 
C-M-a - places cursor at beginning of line
C-M-b - places cursor backwards by one space
C-M-c - exits from innermost recursive edit or minibuffer
C-M-d - forward deletes
C-M-e - places cursor at the end of the line
C-M-f - places cursor forwards by one space
C-M-g - does not exist
C-M-h - marks function

13. C-g runs the command keyboard-quit function. This signals a 'quit' 
condition, and this action happens immediately after the keystroke is 
pressed. It will create a noise in the editor application. 

14. By running the C-h f yank command, I learned that yank reinserts 
the most recently yanked or killed stretch of text.

15. 
/usr/bin:
  total used in directory 292672 available 13979564
  dr-xr-xr-x.   2 root root       69632 Mar  2 11:07 .
  drwxr-xr-x.  15 root root        4096 Dec 22 10:48 ..

Once I navigated into the /usr/bin directory, I used the command 
ls -l > ~/lsAssign1Text.txt to write the ls -l output into a text 
file. Then, I used emacs and typed C-h d /usr/bin and then 
C-x C-s ~/lsAssign1Text2.txt to save the emacs directory output 
into another text file. Then, I used an online text comparing 
software to obtain my answer. The emacs dired command lists a 
few more files than the ls -l command because the dired command 
also lists some subdirectories.
