Exercise 1.6
1. C-x b Enter
2. ( r a n d o m SP 6 9 ) C-j
3. ( s e t q SP x SP ( r a n d o m SP 6 9 ) ) C-j ( s e t q SP y SP 
( r a n d o m SP 6 9 ) ) C-j 
4. (* SP x SP y)
The result is x*y = 62*42 = 2604
5. M-: ( * SP x SP y ) Enter
The result is the same as above, 2604.
6. True randomness cannot be achieved in the mathematical sense. 
When a computer produces a random number, it follows an algorithm 
to fetch the number. A computer cannot truly randomize this process 
because all it can do is follow instructions. The fact that the 
results were the same contradicts the law of true randomness. 
7. If (random) was truly random, the probability that the two-
variable product matches the first calculation is 1/4761 or
0.00021004. This probability is this because the chance of the 
first number being the same is 1 in 69, and the chance of the
second number being the same is 1 in 69. Now multiply 1/69 to
itself to obtain the probability.
