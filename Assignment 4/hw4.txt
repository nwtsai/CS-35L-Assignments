1. This file will log the actions required for homework.

2. I typed
  git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/diffutils.git diffutils-homework4
to copy the repository into my local directory under a new name.

Then, I navigated into the directory with
  cd diffutils-homework4
and then used this command to check out version 3.0 into a new branch:
  git checkout -b 'quote' 'v3.0'

3. Using quote-3.0-patch.txt as my input, I typed:
  patch -p1 < ../quote-3.0-patch.txt
to apply the patch. Here is the output:

patching file src/cmp.c
patching file src/diff.c
patching file src/diff3.c
patching file src/dir.c
patching file src/sdiff.c
patching file src/util.c

4. I learned about the command C-x 4 a from the link provided.

5. I typed:
  emacs C-x 4 a
to open a new file called ChangeLog. I added documentation about the
six files that the patch applied to, describing which lines were
reverted or changed and detailed the intention behind the modification.

6. To commit the changes, I typed:
  git commit -aF ChangeLog

7. To generate the file formatted-patch.txt, I typed:
  git format-patch -1 --stdout > formatted-patch.txt

8. My partner for this lab is Mr. Andrew Arifin.
Name: Andrew Arifin
File: AF-formatted-patch.txt
UID: 604612135

I typed this command to checkout a new branch:
  git checkout -b 'partner' 'v3.0'

Next, I want to apply Andrew's patch. I use the command:
  git am AF-formatted-patch.txt

Now, I want to check that my partner's patch worked. I type:
  
  ./boostrap
  ./configure
  make
  make check

The build succeeded and diff works as it was intended to.
None of the outputted text had grave accents.

9. I typed
  make distdir
  cd diffutils-3.0.2-033c
  cat < ChangeLog

I saw my partner's entry in the ChangeLog:

2016-10-18 Andrew Darryl Arifin <arifin@lnxsrv02.seas.ucla.edu>
		* Update source code of .c files, removing "`" 
                  characters

10. I navigated back to my assign4 directory with
  cd ../ cd ../
To copy the emacs directory to my local working directory, I typed:
  git clone ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs

In order to get gitk to work, I first downloaded X11. Then, I logged
in with ssh -X username@lnxsrv02.seas.ucla.edu

I navigated to the emacs folder with:
  cd CS35L/assign4/emacs
Then, I typed: 
  gitk
and scrolled until I found the newest merge not newer than 2015-01-25.
I saved a screenshot of my window under gitk-screenshot.png

It was labeled

Merge branch ‘master’ into xwidget
