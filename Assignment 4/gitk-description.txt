Each subwindow in my screenshot has a different role.

The top left subwindow shows the tree, the different
branches, and details of the commit/merge message 
written by the author of the commit.

The upper middle subwindow shows the author of the 
commit and their information.

The upper right subwindow shows the date and time of 
which the commit/merge was processed.

The bottom left window gives information about the:

Author
Committer
Parent
Child
Branches
Follows
Precedes

It also gives more information about why the author 
committed and what changes he/she made.

In the same subwindow, if it's not a merge, under the 
above information, a preview of the ChangeLog appears.

Also, a preview of some of the lines changed appears 
below the preview of the ChangeLog, showing the diffs 
of what was changed.

The bottom right subwindow contains the comments of the 
commit/merge.
