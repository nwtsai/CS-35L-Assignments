I first used 
  wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-7.6.tar.gz 
to grab the coreutils-7.6 source files into my local directory. 

To unzip the file, I ran the command 
  tar -zxvf coreutils-7.6.tar.gz 

After navigating to the directory coreutils-7.6 by typing in 
  cd coreutils-7.6
I used 
  mkdir mybin 
to create my own directory. 

Then, I used the command 
  ./configure --prefix=/u/cs/ugrad/tsain/CS35L/assign3/coreutils-7.6/mybin
to configure the path.

In the coreutils-7.6 directory, I typed 
  make 
to compile the files and 
  make install 
to install all the files.

I then typed the command 
  export LC_ALL='en_US.UTF-8' 
and 
  cd mybin 
to change the locale and directory.

Then, I typed 
  ./ls -l /bin/bash 
to reproduce the bug:
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 960392 2015-06-12 8:17 /bin/bash

I went to Brady's patch on the internet, and made a file by typing
  emacs mypatch_ls 
in the coreutils-7.6 directory, copying and pasting Brady's patch 
into the file.
 
I then typed in 
  patch -p1 < mypatch_ls 
to apply the patch, modifying the ls file.

I then typed 
  make 
to recompile the program.

To get back to the assign3 directory, I typed 
  cd ../

To compare recently modified file using both ls commands:

I used the command 
  ./mybin/bin/ls -l ./coreutils-7.6.tar.gz 
and got the buggy format:
-rw-r--r-- 1 tsain csugrad 10014650 2016-10-10 16:14 ./coreutils-7.6.tar.gz

I used the command 
  ./coreutils-7.6/src/ls -l ./coreutils-7.6.tar.gz 
and got the correct format:
-rw-r--r-- 1 tsain csugrad 10014650 Oct 10 16:14 ./coreutils-7.6.tar.gz

Now, to compare the one-year-old file and its varying formats:

I used the command 
  emacs yearOldFile
Then I typed something into the file, and then pressed 
  C-x C-c 
to quit and save the file.
To change the date of the file, I used 
  touch -t 1510100000 yearOldFile

Then I used 
  ./mybin/src/ls -l ./yearOldFile 
to get the buggy format:
-rw-r--r-- 1 tsain csugrad 32 2015-10-10 00:00 ./yearOldFile

I used the command 
  ./coreutils-7.6/src/ls -l ./yearOldFile 
to get the correct format:
-rw-r--r-- 1 tsain csugrad 32 Oct 10  2015 ./yearOldFile

The difference between the recently modified files and year old one 
is that post-patch formatting includes the timestamp only if the file 
was created in the same year. If the file was created in a different 
year, then it will exclude the timestamp and will replace the time with 
just the year that the file was created. If the file was created in the 
same year as the current year, the post-patch format will exclude the 
year, and will display the timestamp of its creation instead.
