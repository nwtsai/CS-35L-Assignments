Q1.
The line "case_long_iso_time_style:" is actually a goto label. Brady 
had already removed the goto line, so the label was unnecessary. On 
the level of functionality, leaving the line would be acceptable. 
However, this line should be removed, as Brady rightfully did so, 
because it could be a source of confusion for other programmers 
trying to read the code. It is always best to remove unnecessary 
lines in code so that the code can be more easily read.

Q2.
If your company adopts the patched version of Coreutils instead of the
old version, you may make the dates of when files are created to be 
hard to read for non English-speaking people. The old version was readable
by all people, while the patched version tailors to English-speaking
people. Furthermore, if some of the company uses commands that rely
on reading and inputting the old format, this could affect all of
these commands and could result in many bugs. 

Q3.
The script doesn't work, because it needs an argument greater than 0 bits. 
How can a randomline generator script function when there are no lines?
Furthermore, getrandbits(0) will not work with 0 bits. The script cannot 
choose lines from an empty sequence, because this will cause undefined
behavior.

Q4.
Running the script with python3 generates the following error:

Input: /usr/local/cs/bin/python3 randline.py -file
Output: File "randline.py", line 65
	except IOError as (errno, strerror):
                      ^
      SyntaxError: invalid syntax

This happens because the newer version of python, python3, has new syntax
rules. In fact, it does not accept the arguments of the IOError as
(errno, strerror).  
Running the script with python2 results in the program running as it was
intended to, returning no errors. This probably means that the person
who wrote randline.py wrote it before python3 was released. Programmers
must remember to read up on language updates and update their code
correspondingly to avoid errors like the one shown above.
